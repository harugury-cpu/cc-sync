# deep-research

> **AI-powered deep research with multi-agent source verification and structured outputs.**

Turn a single question into a comprehensive, citation-backed research report — automatically.

## Quick Start

### 1. Add the marketplace (once)

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/fivetaku/gptaku_plugins.git
```

### 2. Install the plugin

```
/plugin install deep-research
```

### 3. Restart Claude Code

Cache loads on startup — a restart is required after install.

### 4. Start researching

```
/deep-research AI coding assistants productivity impact
```

Claude will ask a few scoping questions, then deploy parallel research agents and deliver a structured report.

## Why deep-research?

- **Parallel agents, not sequential searches** — 3-5 agents run simultaneously across web, academic, and technical sources, cutting research time significantly
- **Source quality ratings (A–E)** — Every source is graded from peer-reviewed papers (A) to speculative posts (E), so you always know what you're reading
- **Hallucination-resistant** — Every factual claim requires an inline citation; key claims are cross-verified against at least 2 independent sources
- **Resumable sessions** — Research state is saved to `state.json`; pick up where you left off if a session is interrupted
- **Complete deliverables** — Executive summary, full sectioned report, bibliography, and an optional interactive website — all generated automatically

    │
    ▼
Phase 1: Question Scoping
  └─ AskUserQuestion → focus, depth, audience, sources
    │
    ▼
Phase 2: Retrieval Planning
  └─ Break into 3-5 subtopics → search query generation → plan approval
    │
    ▼
Phase 3: Iterative Querying  ←──────────────────┐
  ├─ Web Research Agent (x2-3)                  │
  ├─ Academic/Technical Agent (x1-2)            │ refine if gaps
  └─ Cross-Reference Agent (x1)                 │

Phase 4: Source Triangulation ─────────────────-┘
  └─ Cross-verify key claims (≥2 sources) → A–E quality rating
    │
    ▼
Phase 5: Knowledge Synthesis
  └─ Structure → write sections → inline citations
    │
    ▼
Phase 6: Quality Assurance
  └─ Hallucination check → citation verification → completeness
    │
    ▼
Phase 7: Output & Packaging
  └─ Executive summary + full report + bibliography + website (optional)

## Agents

Three agent types run in parallel during Phase 3:

| Agent | Count | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Web Research | 2–3 | Latest news, trends, market data |
| Academic / Technical | 1–2 | Papers, specs, official docs |
| Cross-Reference | 1 | Fact-checking key claims |

---

## Source Quality Ratings

| Grade | Type | Examples |
|-------|------|---------|
| **A** | Peer-reviewed, systematic reviews | Nature, Lancet, IEEE |
| **B** | Official docs, clinical guidelines | FDA, W3C, WHO |
| **C** | Expert opinion, industry reports | Gartner, conferences |
| **D** | Preprints, white papers | arXiv, company blogs |
| **E** | Anecdotal, speculative | Social media, forums |
