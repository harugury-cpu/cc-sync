## Parse Arguments

Inspect `$ARGUMENTS` to determine the action:

| Argument Pattern | Action | Skill |
|-----------------|--------|-------|
| `resume [session_id]` | Resume a previous research session | deep-research-main |
| `status` | List all research sessions and their progress | deep-research-main |
| `query` | Launch interactive query builder | deep-research-query |
| `[any other text]` | Start new research on the given topic | deep-research-main |
| (no argument) | Show interactive menu via AskUserQuestion | See below |

## No Argument Provided

**EXECUTE:** 아래 JSON으로 AskUserQuestion 도구를 즉시 호출한다:

      ],
      "multiSelect": false
    }
  ]
}
```

After user selection:
- **New Research** → Ask for topic, then invoke deep-research-main skill
- **Resume Session** → List sessions from `RESEARCH/*/state.json`, let user pick, then invoke deep-research-main resume flow
- **Session Status** → List all sessions with progress summary
- **Query Builder** → Invoke deep-research-query skill

## Execute

Once the action is determined, follow the corresponding skill's execution flow.
